Economy is a measure of how much humans can change physical reality.

Economy is driven by two things:
 1. human   resources to accomplish desired change
 3. natural resources to accomplish desired change

The cost of anything is determined by the cost of the above 2 items

Nothing in the world has intrinsic value. All value is arbitrarily assigned by people. E.g., how much do I want to get paid in order to do the work? Or, how much do I want to get paid in order to provide a resource?

Technology creates new goods and services. Technology can change the price points at which people are willing to provide their labor or resources. Still, technology isn't change the price of a resource, it is merely changing the price at which people are willing to do or provide it.
