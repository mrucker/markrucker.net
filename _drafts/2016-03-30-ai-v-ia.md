AI - Artificial Intelligence
IA - Intelligence Augmentation

Is there a difference? A "Principle of Demarcation"?

Elevator v Self Driving Car?

Elevator as AI
 * knows the exact distance between floors
 * knows the laws of physics
 * knows when to start and stop
 * knows to not close the door on passengers

Elevator as IA
 * only goes where people tell it to go
 * augments humans velocity when moving vertically
 * augments humans ability to move weight vertically

New Car Technology as AI
 * replace all human responsibility during trip
 * no controls available for human override

New Car Technology as IA
 * rear cameras for collision avoidance when backing up
 * anti-lock breaks
 * power steering

Technology -> a process by which humans can change the world
 * Creates opportunities (elevators enable lifting very heavy weights)
 * Removes opportunities (elevators prevent stopping between floors)

Technology is value neutral?
Application is value positive?

Tool -- finite input to finite output
AI -- infinite input to finite output || finite input to infinite output || infinite input to infinite output
