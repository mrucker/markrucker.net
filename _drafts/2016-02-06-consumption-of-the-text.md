Writing has always been a dark art, for that reason I've hated it. No where else has effort on my part resulted in such inconsistent outcomes (with the potential exception of web development), a case study in learned helplessness. Case in point, I have received a 5.5 and a 3.5 on the GRE Analytical Writing section.

I have now spent the better part of three years attempting to conquer this bane once and for all. Finally, after much reflection, reading, and practice I've finally begun to create systems of hypothesis that are yielding consistent results.

 + Predicate: The information one would like to share
 + Subject  : The object one would like to share information about

I'd like to propose that the goal of any written communication is to share information. What one hopes that shared information accomplishes can change from dispatch to dispatch (e.g., win friends, influence people, command subordinates), but no matter the ends the means is still sharing information. I point this out because it provides a universal starting place for a remedial education in writing: information sharing.

Let's start with a simple proposition: in order to share information two pieces are needed, an object and information about the object. This is a big claim, and much will be made of it, so let's spend a moment trying to break it.

First, let's look at a simple case that supports the premise: John is five. In this case our object is "the boy" and our information is his age "five". We now know the boys age. Now, to logically disprove the premise we'd need to show at least one case that either shares information without an object or shares information with only an object. Let's start with the first one. Can we share information without an object? If we go back to our simple example let's drop our object "the boy" and say that I only share the information with you "five". Has any information been shared? Without a reference I'd argue the answer is no. For all you know I could be telling you the name of my cat or the number of years I spent in undergrad or how much money I spent on dinner last night. Without a reference I might as well have shared nonsense with you and you'd never know, "dhorm," (a word I made up). It could be argued that information has still been shared because you could potentially sleuth out my object. However, until you know the object, "five," still means nothing to you.

I'm going to share a piece of information without a referenced object: five. That's the piece of information, the number five. Without me telling you anything else

Experiential information could be an exception to this. I can play a song for you without providing any object and information will definitely be shared. However, I believe the case of experiential information transfer is a unique case where the information itself is the object being referenced. Furthermore, I'd argue that information shared through written word is rarely experiential. For this reason all sharing must have an object and information. Otherwise nothing is shared.
