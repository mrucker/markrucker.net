Many, though not all, of these ideas and comments came from reading Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson and Martin Gardner. The rest came from who knows where.

Calculus itself is part of a branch of mathematics known as [Analysis][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis]

There are two big "branches" of Calculus [Integral][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#Integral_calculus] and [Differential][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#Differential_calculus]. These branches are shown to be different names for the same concept in the [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus].

Calculus studies how change in one variable effects the value of a second variable.

Turning discrete observations into a continuous function allows for infinite observations to be dealt with in a single statement.

Math and Natural Observations are two different thing. While it isn't true in our world, it is possible to imagine living in a world where natural phenomenon can't be represented by continuous functions. An example of a natural phenomenon that can't be summed up by functions is the relationship between the length of time I wait at a light and my mood.

"dx" can be read as a little bit of x.

Can I graph a probability? Probability seems like a good way to capture discrete events that can't otherwise be represented by a continuous function. How do I use a probability to make decisions?

Math is simple once we have the language (aka symbols) to describe it?

The expression of a relationship between multiple variables is called a "Function" in mathematics.

An implicit function has multiple variables but none of them explicitly solved for. (e.g., x^2 + y^2 = l^2 is an implicit function of x and y). Any implicit function can be turned into an explicit function.

By discovering and defining Functions we can know what to do in order to reach desired results.
