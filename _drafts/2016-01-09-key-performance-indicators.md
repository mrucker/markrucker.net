About two months ago I was asked by my CIO to design a KPI system. I'd never worked on a project quite like it but felt confident we could do it. Little did I know how complicated the task was actually going to be. What follows are the lessons I've learned on my journey to a final solution. It is worth noting I started from scratch -- so, many of my ideas may not be relevant to a project that is adding new indicators to an existing KPI system.

#Math As Programming#

#Understand The Types Of Measurement#

#Drill Downs Increase Validation Time Not Coding Time#

#Consider The Humble Double Entry System Of Accounting#

#Calculate Results In More Than One Way#

#When Bootstrapping A KPI System Consider Automatic Corrections#

#Avoid Double Counting By Defining Sets#
