This will be a look at information, its sources, and how humans consume it.

#Definition Of Information#
For our purposes information is either an observation or a record of an observation. Reality itself is not information until it is observed. It might seem this definition would leave out meta-data. However, I'd argue that such ideas would still count as information, since they are observations of one's thoughts. This definition also has the nice side effect of finally answering that age old question: if a tree falls in the forest and one is there to hear it then it doesn't make any information.

#Meaningful Information#
I'd like to take a moment to digress and distinguish between what I see as "human-meaningful" and "human-meaningless" information. At the most basic level information must have two parts for a human to give it meaning: the object the information describes and the information itself. Without both parts information is "human-meaningless" (to be clear this is not the same as saying information has no meaning if a human can't assign the meaning). For example, let's say we have the information "five" without a referent object for it to modify. In this case "five" tells us nothing: it could refer to five cows or five years or a high-five. Even if we add a modifier to further define "five" such as "years" we still have nothing. Are we saying every five years our planet orbits the sun or that five years ago I moved schools or that a child is five years old?

#Sources Of Information:#
 + Experience - The simple fact of what is. In the case of our day to do day life these would be sensory. I see the sky is cloudy; I feel nauseous; I hear the fire alarm; Todd wrote me to say he is angry.
 + Perception - The meaning we add to our experience. In the case of day to day life these would be implications. I can't go stargazing; I am going to be sick; There is a fire in the building; Todd won't talk at dinner.

These separate sources of information bring out a unique aspect of human existence. We are always, in every moment, both experiencing and perceiving our reality. During my morning drive into the office I may miss a light. There is our experience that we had to stop for a traffic signal and then there is our perception that we are going to be late for a meeting with our boss. Or we may see a comet in the night sky and believe it is an auspice of abundance. Or we may read an email about Julie being fired and breathe a sigh of relief that it wasn't us.

#Types Of Information:#
 + Historical - 
 + Predictive -
