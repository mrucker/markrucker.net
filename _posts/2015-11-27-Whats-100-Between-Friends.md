title : What's A $100 Between Friends
---
For the last two years I've worked in the field of recovery auditing. This has meant that I spend my days creating software to examine historical financial records for errors. Or in other words, I build software abstractions on top of social abstractions on top of chronological abstractions. Understandably, the endeavor has pushed the limits of my existential questioning. 

For example, let's take two imaginary companies, Acme and Omega. Ten years ago Omega installed windows in a new Acme store for $100. Omega mistakenly sends the bill for this service to Acme twice. Acme doesn't notice and pays both bills. Now, ten years later, my software discovers the mistake, triggering a $100 reimbursement request.

Reflecting on the above example, to some extent I feel that I freed up $100 that can be spent on other productive services. To a fuller extent though I feel that isn't true because two things happened as a result of the discovery, Alpha recovered $100 while Omega lost $100. The complete net financial change is $0. What really changed then is that Alpha's "Power" increased relative to Omega. Relative being the operative adverb here.

Of course, none of this matters if Omega refuses to acknowledge the mistake. Perhaps Omega claims that there is a statute of limitation on financial transactions. Because all money and services have already been exchanged there are no longer any "carrots" available to resolve this particular transaction. The reimbursement request, to some extent then, isn't worth $100 but rather what society says it is.

As far as I can tell the rabit hole continues forever, everything being contingent upon some other underlying structure for meaning. The magnetic polorazation of the Hard Drives my software manipulates depends on human interpretation which depends on social precedence which is built on historical precedence. As Mr. Russell said, "Turtles all the way down."
