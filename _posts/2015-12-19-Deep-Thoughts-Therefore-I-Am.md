Thoughts from [Discourse on the Method][1]:

 * "For to be possessed of good mental powers is not sufficient; the principal matter is to apply them well. The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as of the greatest virtues, and those who proceed very slowly may, provided they always follow the straight road, really advance much faster that those who, though they run, forsake it."

 * One should contain reform efforts to their own person. To do otherwise invites too many unintended or harmful consequences. Each person in turn must decide for themselves what reforms are required.
 
 * Four step Method to attain all knowldege a mind is capabable of:
    
    1. Accept as true only that which has made itself obvious
    2. Break complex ideas down into as small of parts as possible
    3. Understand simple ideas before more complex ones
    4. Never leave out any detail or consequence that comes from knowledge
