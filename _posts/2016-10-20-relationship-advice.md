Ok, so to start with I want to lay out a couple of foundational ideas. These may not make sense now but keep them in mind while you read my explanations below and hopefully it'll start to click.

1. Math is a language. It has more in common with English than arithmetic.
2. Math and the physical world are different things, just like with words. (I.e., I can say the water is cold but it doesn't mean that it is. Similarly, I can say that 1 + 1 = 2 but it doesn't mean that it does (e.g., 1 cup of water + 1 cup of popcorn doesn't equal 2 cups of soggy popcorn).)
3. Math is not "proven". The word proof should be erased from the mathematical vocabulary in my opinion. Math is argued over and debated. Some people win these arguments until better arguments come along. The winner's arguments are called "proofs".
4. Math is a language designed to do one thing, communicate relationships with perfect precision.

Alright, I've been trying to decide how to best organize these ideas. The problem is that math isn't linear, so there is no natural organization. I think I'm going to start with some interesting ideas to show what I'm offering here and then proceed historically.

As I say above, math is a language that was created to express relationships. Try to wipe your mind of all you've ever learned about arithmetic and focus on this relationship aspect. With this relationship approach we can begin to organize math into "kinds" of relationships: 

+ linear -- relationships that grow equally fast or slow
+ quadratic -- relationships that grow either faster or slower with bigger values
+ factorial -- relationships that grow way way way faster as they get bigger
+ logarithmic -- relationships that grow slower and slower and slower
+ asymptotic -- relationships that get closer and closer to a fixed value

All of the above relationships we experience on a daily basis (with the exception maybe of factorial). The relationship between how far I press my accelerator down and how fast my car goes is linear. The relationship between my savings account and my interest rate is quadratic. The relationship between earthquake intensity and the Richter scale is logarithmic. The relationship between how often I practice basketball layups and how consistently I can make layups is asymptotic. No calculations are required here.

Now, as human's studied these various relationships two special kinds were discovered. Inferential relationships and deductive relationships. Inferential relationships are ones where we take a few specific experiences and make general claims about the world. An example might be, every person I've ever met named "Mark" is a man. Therefore only men have the name Mark. Deductive relationships on the other hand are where we go from general to specific. I am coaching the women's volleyball team, therefore the player who gets jersey 10 is going to be a woman. Inferential relationships continue to be a thorn in the side of mathematicians to this day. Deductive relationships, on the other hand, are have been mastered, though they have lost a lot of their standing within the mathematical pantheon.

Within the category of deductive relationships there is an even more special kind of relationship, Equivalence. Or in other words, cheeseburgers are to hamburgers as equivalence is to deduction. Equivalent relationships are a stricter form of deductive relationships where both sides of the relationship deductively imply the other. Interestingly human's biggest interaction with equivalent relationships is in nature. Human relationships don't tend to have any equivalence though they may be equivocal (ba dum cha).

Around 400 B.C. Greeks began to systematically study inferential and deductive relationships. In particular, they studied two areas: geometry and logic (aka syllogisms). In geometry Greeks began to show certain states/values were equivalent to other states/values. E.g., they showed that the area of a square is equivalent to the square of one side. The interesting thing is that they didn't ever "solve" the area of a square. They just showed the relationship between the side and area existed. Similarly, when studying triangles, they never showed that the interior angles of a triangle are equivalent to 180°. Instead they showed that the interior angles of a triangle are equivalent to the interior angles of every other triangle. That's what is so interesting about their work. There is no arithmetic. They simply show that A is equivalent to B without doing any math.

As the Greeks built longer and longer equivalence chains, (i.e., A is equivalent to B, B is equivalent to C, C is equivalent to D, therefore A is equivalent to D), they began to find that relationships that didn't appear to be equivalent at all actually are. E.g., saying that the area of a square is equivalent to the square of its side, is equivalent to saying all triangle's internal angles are equivalent to each other. Eventually, over several hundred years they discovered that all of geometry as we know it to day is equivalent to saying 5 basic rules are true:

1. A perfectly straight line can be drawn between any two points
2. Any straight line can be extended forever and remain straight
3. Given a straight line a circle can be drawn using the line segment as a radius
4. All right angles are equal (note, this doesn't say all right angles equal 90°)
5. Two, non parallel line segments will intersect once and only once 

They named these five basic rules axioms (as in the "atoms" of geometry). These rules seemed so basic and intuitive they didn't try to break them down any further. These rules and all of the geometry that you learned in high school were recorded in a book called Euclid's Elements. This book is considered by many historians to be the bedrock of western civilization. The reason is simple, even though the book is several thousand pages long you can teach somebody the five rules and they know everything in the book. Even today that is still how advanced mathematics is taught. In my grad school classes the first week we memorize the basic axioms of what we're studying. We then spend the rest of the semester applying those axioms in useful ways.

When a mathematician says they have "proven" something, 9 times out of 10 what they mean is they have shown that some statement is equivalent to accepted axioms. The reason this isn't a "proof", at least as most people think about it, is that the axioms aren't "proven" -- they are simply accepted. Axioms are assumptions no matter how simple and intuitive they may seem. If you agree with my assumptions then I have "proven" X. However, despite this fallacy axioms are still incredibly powerful for two reasons:

1. They can communicate extremely complex ideas to new students very easily
2. They can often be built upon and added to without breaking previous work 

These properties of Axioms are the bedrock for why mathematical knowledge continues to advance. Math can, with moderate ease in relation to its complexity, be passed on to new generations and new generations can add to it with confidence that they are actually improving things.

Well there you go. A basic introduction to axioms. An interesting application of Axioms is the Turing Machine (if you've ever heard of it). When people say Alan Turing created computers what they really mean is he discovered the seven axioms that define all computers (seen here). That's it, just seven. Every computer that you have in your house from your thermostat to your smartphone to your laptop is equivalent to Turing's seven axioms.

I'll stop there. Next time I'll link Axioms to Algebra (again without any arithmetic). Then after that I'll go to convergence, which in my opinion is one of the most powerful and simple ideas in math. I tried really hard to keep this accessible to people without advanced mathematics education. For those of you who read it, I'd love to hear what parts you think are too technical and wordy.
