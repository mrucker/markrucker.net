I've always had a predeliction towards doubt. This may sound surprising given my relgious history, but it is nonetheless true. This contradiction was possible because my doubt has been selective, dwelling on matters of philosophy and ethics while ignoring issues of history and physics. I think this has largely been because the latter seemed trivial and the former interesting. Lately I've been reading Descartes' *Meditations on First Philosophy* and it has caused me to rethink my disposition towards doubt. To keep this examination brief I am going to focus on three areas where doubt has substantially impacted my ideas and considere the implications of this doubt.
