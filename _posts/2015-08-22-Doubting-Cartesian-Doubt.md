I've always had a predeliction towards doubt. This may sound surprising given my relgious history, but it is nonetheless true. This contradiction was possible because my doubt has been selective, dwelling on matters of philosophy and ethics while ignoring issues of history and physics. I think this was largely been because, in my youth, the latter seemed trivial and uninteresting. Lately I've been reading Descartes' *Meditations on First Philosophy*[^1] which has led me to rethink my doubting disposition. 

#What I've Doubted#

To keep this brief I will only look at the effects of Cartesian Doubt[^2] in three very personal domains: politics, ethics, religion. The patterns I'll deliniate fractal out in small ways throughout my life and personality.

At one time I was unquestionably republican. My first vote was for the Republican Party. However, doubt required that I always search for better and better reasons to justify my positions. Every new idea required a re-evaluation of my own. Every argument, no matter how trenchant, must have an equally powerful counterpoint I should be aware of. Every politician, no matter how egregious their actions, must be acting on information I'm as yet unaware of.

At one time I had an unquestionable good old boy code of ethics. Work hard, do your best, take responsibility, care for women and leave things better than you found them was life blood. For my doubting self these values without reason weren't enough. When faced with ethical conflicts doubt called me to first re-examine my values before judging others. Surely disagreements over what is good in life were the result of limitations in my own observations rather than limitations in others.

At one time I was an historical-grammatical[^3] Christian. Every metaphysical question could be answered by the biblical text. Simply accepting the theology given to me wasn't sufficient. If there were questions I didn't have answers to then I didn't know enough.

#The Good#

All this doubting has had many positive effects in my life. I am more informed about many subjects than my peers. I am more humble and open-minded with people of various positions. I am able to carry on conversations and succeed socially in very diverse settings. I have turned my constant questioning and learning into a fulfilling hobby. I have a lot more confidence in my decisions and judgements.

#The Bad#

All this doubting has also had many negative effects. I can be much slower to act than many of my peers. I can come across as a pedant or know-it-all. I have yet to find a "tribe" where I feel like I truly belong. I have lost many friendships when my doubting led me to new unacceptable answers (e.g. when I changed religions). I'm often bored by conversations that cover arguments that I consider old, incorrect or inconsequential.

#The Unchanged#

This is what causes me to most reconsider my doubt. For all the ways that I've learned and grown from it, a large portion of my life remains unchanged. Despite becoming atheistic I still pray, perform holy rites and exercise faith but now I call it journaling, meditating and reminding myself I don't know what the future holds. Even though I've changed my politics I still volunteer and donate to the same social institutions. Even though I no longer think my ethics are the only "right" way to live I still work hard, do my best and practice honesty even when the above morals aren't expedient. 

#Conclusion#

For all the work, time and social costs my doubt has had a minimal impact on my actions. All that has really changed has been the internal narrative I use to justify my actions. This pattern of mostly re-justifying old behavior  calls forth the specter of Confirmation Bias. Has it been worth it? Have I made any progress? Or have I just been running on a treadmill powered by my own demons?
