With so many tech blogs I feel I need to give some justification for one more.

This blog's main goal is to provide me with a place to record what I learn as a programmer. By writing I hope to increase my retention of new information and to build up a store house of knowledge I and others can benefit from over time. Topics will vary but will likely favor theory over practice.

For each post I will strive to accomplish three objectives:

  1.  Sort through the many online sources and create a central reference location for those I feel are best on a topic
  2.  Briefly summarize the sources that I reference (to protect against broken links and facilitate quick look-ups)
  3.  When appropriate provide source code samples demonstrating learned information.
