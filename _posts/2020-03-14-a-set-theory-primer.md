Set theory is ubiquitous in modern mathematics. As such, over the course of my studies, I've created a complex patchwork of ideas and notation from various sources without any clear singular thought. This post is my effort to consider all these ideas at once in order to clean up inconsistencies and discover meaningful gaps.

# Interpretation

Sets are often described as collections of objects. However, such a description, while helpful for intuitive understanding, isn't strictly necessary for the theory to hold. Rather, as is the case with many abstract mathematical theories, the results and contributions of set theory have been found to be true many families of items (e.g., boolean-valued modelsrather than collections of objects).

# History {% cite ferreiros2019early %} {% cite randall2017alternative %}

The seminal work in set theory occured in the late 19th century and can be attributed to two primary figures: Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind. This early work now belongs to what is known as naïve set theory. The next major development occured around 1900 when Ernst Zermelo and Bertrand Russell independently discovered what is now known as Russel's Paradox. This discovery motivated considerable effort to create a consistent axiomatic system of sets -- ultimately leading to well known results such as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (which utilized the axiom of choice to remove paradoxes) and the Neumann-Gödel-Bernays set theory (which used classes to remove paradoxes).
