Over the last several months I have been learning a lot of new material on my own. Over this period, I have realized that my learning can be organized into three strategies. By understanding these strategies and their roles I hope to become a more productive learner.

#Learning Strategies#
1. Exposure (comprehension, communication)
2. Connections (understanding, theory)
3. Implications (memorization, application)

#Exposure#
Exposure learning is the highest level of the three strategies. It is characterized by a light touch that can easily jump from one subject to another. For me, exposure learning is defined by comfort rather form. Because exposure learning primarily involves consuming information I already know I used to considered it less important. However, I now think it is the key to life long learning. It allows for constant knowledge refreshing without wearing a learner out.

#Connections#
Connection learning is the level below exposure. It is characterized by aha moments and wikipedia articles. I find this level to be one of the most fun. Here I start to discover the ties between lots of areas I already know. For long term recall this is critical as the more connections the easier it is to remember. It also corrects small misunderstandings by looking at a subject from many perspectives. With its focus on theory though it can cause a false sense of subject mastery.

#Implications#
Implication learning is the deepest level of learning. It is characterized by a narrow and intense focus. Implication learning requires getting hands dirty and can be frustrating. No misunderstanding is accepted at this level otherwise incorrect implications and applications are reached.

#Personal Learning Tendencies#
Historically I've spent most of my time at the Connections level. In prepping for the GRE over the last few months though I've found that I need considerable more of Exposure and Implication learning. The amount of subject matter I've learned can only be retained if I find light reading material that exercises my new knowledge. At the same time, the GRE and Grad School are about application and demand that I am able to understand the implications of theories. Going forward I am working on having a more balanced learning diet.
