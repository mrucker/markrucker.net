A simple exploration of information, its sources, and how humans consume it.

#Definition Of Information#
For our purposes information is either an observation or a record of an observation. Reality itself, as it unfolds, is not information. It might seem this definition would leave out meta-data. However, I'd argue that such ideas would still count as information because they are recorded observations of one's thoughts. This definition also has the nice side effect of finally answering that age old question: if a tree falls in the forest and one is there to hear it then it doesn't make any information.

#Sources Of Information:#
 + Primary (observation, experience)
 + Secondary (symbols, representation)
 + Intuition

#Types Of Information:#
 + Historical
 + Predictive
