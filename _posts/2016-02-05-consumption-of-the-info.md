A study of information, its sources, and how humans consume it.

#Definition Of Information#
For my purposes here, information is either an observation or a record of an observation. This definition means that reality itself is not information until it is observed. It might seem that this definition would leave out ideas, which can't be observed. However, such entities are information, since they are observations of one's thoughts. This definition also has the nice side effect of finally answering that age old question: if a tree falls in the forest and one is there to hear it then it doesn't make any information.

#Meaningful Information#
In the task of information consumption, information can be broken down into two types: human-meaningful and human-meaningless. Human-meaningful information requires a subject and information about the subject. If either of these is missing then the information becomes human-meaningless. To be clear, this is not the same as saying the information is meaningless; it is simply meaningless to a human. For example, let's say we have the information "five". Without knowing the object that "five" describes it tells us nothing -- it could refer to five cows or five years or a high-five. Even if we add a modifier to further define "five", such as "years", we still have nothing. But, if we add the subject Bobby, and say Bobby is five years old, then it has now become meaningful.

#Sources Of Information:#
 + Experiencing - What our senses feel. (E.g., I see the sky is cloudy.)
 + Interpreting - What our senses mean. (E.g., I should expect rain.)

These separate sources highlight a unique aspect of humanity. We are always, in every moment, both experiencing and interpreting reality. For example, if I miss a light while driving into the office, I experience having to stop and I probably interpret it as an annoyance.

#Types Of Information:#
 + Historical   - Information concerning completed events in the past
 + Predictive   - Information that makes claims about past or future events
 + Qualitative  - Information about an event not using a shared measurement
 + Quantitative - Information about an event using a shared measurement
